 Robo Match

This is my game that i have made using javascript as well as HTML & CSS. I created this game for users to match their favourite iconic robots in a fun game. 

My game is for the purpose of the user to have fun and try to play the game with the least amount of moves.

Features

My game has 3 pages. This first is the home page where the user will be able to see the name of the game and a button to take you to the game. At the top of the page there is a navigation bar which will take the user to the other pages. The next page in the navigation bar is the game page. This page will display the game for the user to play as well as a restart button for the user to restart the game if they make a mistake or trying to get the best score. There is also a score board which will have the number of moves you take to complete the game. In the score board there is a score which will only increase once a pair has been made. The third page is a instruction page which shows the user the steps needed to play the game.

Navigation Bar

Featured on all three pages, the full responsive navigation bar includes links to the Logo, Home page, Game and Instruction page and is identical in each page to allow for easy navigation. This section will allow the user to easily navigate from page to page across all devices without having to revert back to the previous page via the ‘back’ button.

Landing Page
The landing page will include a game name as well as a link to the game for the user to start playing. 

The Footer

The footer section includes links to the relevant social media sites for the game. The links will open to a new tab to allow easy navigation for the user. The footer is valuable to the user as it encourages them to keep connected via social media.

Game

The game page includes the game which will have 12 cards displayed in the middle of the page. At the bottom of the page there is a restart button for the user to press to start the game again. This will restart the score and moves from the score board also. The score board will be displayed on the right of the game. This will entail a score and moves counter which will increase once the game has begun. 

Instructions

The instruction page will have all the instructions in number order for the user to read before playing the game. There is also a link to the game for the player to go straight to the game. 


Features Left to Implement

General layout with larger screens I was unable to get the contact section and the resume side by side when viewing on a larger device for better use. This is the same for the home page as seen in my wireframes.

My service cards looks unappealing on bigger screens My service cards are not formatting in the way i would like when on bigger screens.

Testing

I have made my website pleasing to the eye on both mobile and desktop. I have used media queries to change the layout of my website which is pleasing to the eyes. In the portfolio section i have increased the image columns to give the user a better experience.
